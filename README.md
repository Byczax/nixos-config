# Nixos Configuration

This is Nixos configuration using flakes and home manager.

I try my best to make it clean and by the rules of nixos community.


## TODO

Things that are annoying after loading fresh instance

- [ ] Logging back into all accounts
- [ ] Ability to store encrypted ssh keys in repository (forgot to back them up, idk if it's good idea)
